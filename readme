This implementation of the engine does not have implemented all the points asked due to a mismanagment on my part,
this engine only supports de drag and drop functionaloity and basic camera movement(only forward, back, right, left, up or down).
I'd like to apologize and assure this mismanagment will not happen again in the future.
